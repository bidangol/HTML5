        Earth is a rare planet that contains living things in it. Scientist haven't yet found a Earth like planet yet, or at 
      least a planet that has any living beings, which makes this planet so special. Earth's plates are moving up to 4 inches per 
      year but most of them move even slower, it has changed a lot from when it was born (4.6 billion years ago) to now. The 
      Earth and other planets are smaller version to the sun. Earth formed like all other planets in 4.6 billion years ago the 
      inner core was 9726.85 celsius and the crust was 100 - 600 celsius, now the core is 4,400 to 6,000 celsius and the hottest 
      part of the crust is 200 to 400 celsius.
