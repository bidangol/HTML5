  Earth's plates are moving up to 4 inches per year but most of them move even slower, it has changed 
  a lot from when it was born (4.6 billion years ago) to now. The Earth and other planets are smaller
  version to the sun. Earth formed like all other planets in 4.6 billion years ago the inner core was
  9726.85 celsius and the crust was 100 - 600 celsius, now the core is 4,400 to 6,000 celsius and the 
  hottest part of the crust is 200 to 400 celsius.
