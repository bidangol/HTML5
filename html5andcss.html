  Hiccup is a character in the movie 'How to train a dragon'. Gas prices are painfully high this Memorial Day weekend as millions of Americans hit the road for the unofficial start of summer.

  The $4.60-a-gallon average price for regular gas an all-time high — and pump prices are also very elevated on an inflation-adjusted basis.
  
  Real (that is, inflation-adjusted) gas prices haven’t been this high heading into Memorial Day weekend since 2012, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
  
  The all-time high for average inflation-adjusted gas prices was set in June 2008 at $5.38 a gallon.
  
  The price of gas has surged by 30% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. The $4.60-a-gallon price today is about 50% higher than last Memorial Day weekend.
