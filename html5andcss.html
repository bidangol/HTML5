      <h2>Who is hiccup?</h2>
      <p>
      Hiccup is a character in the movie "How to train a dragon (HTTYD)". Hiccup second knew dragons are friendly, then he spreaded about that thing. By flying Astrid (girl character) in the clouds, then he trained Monstrous Nightmare (Hookfang), Zippleback (Barf and Belch), Deadly Nadder (Stormfly) and Gronkle (Meatlug) dragons near Snotlout, Ruffnut and Tuffnut (Ruff and Tuff), Astrid who already know they are freindly and Fishlegs. Last everyone now know that they are friendly because the few of the character ride the dragons. But still some are there enemy of the same reason.
